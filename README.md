# MobileUnityGame -WORK IN PROGRESS

## Game Description

The game involves dragging and merging objects of different types to create higher-tier objects. Initially, the player interacts with objects tagged as "YellowStar", which can be dragged around the screen. When two "YellowStar" objects collide, they merge into a new object of a higher tier, such as "GoldCoin". This merging process continues through multiple tiers, eventually leading to the highest-tier object, the "BlackStar". The goal of the game may involve strategic merging to reach the highest tier and maximize points or achievements.

## Coding Used

The game primarily involves game development using the Unity game engine and C# as its primary scripting language. The provided script is written in C# and is used to control the behavior of the draggable objects, collision detection, merging logic, and instantiation of new objects. The script utilizes touch input for mobile devices, allowing players to drag objects with their fingers. Additionally, it uses Unity's physics engine for object movement and interaction.

Overall, the game combines elements of puzzle-solving, strategy, and casual gameplay, with coding used to implement game mechanics, interactions, and progression systems.
